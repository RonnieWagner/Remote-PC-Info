Remote PC Info Tool - Instructions

Overview:
This tool gathers system information from a remote Windows PC through a simple graphical window. It retrieves:
- Logged in user
- PC model
- Last reboot time
- Total and free disk space (in GB)
The script automatically requests admin rights and launches its GUI without requiring the user to open PowerShell manually.

How to Use:

1. Copy the Script to Your Desktop
The script must be saved on your local Windows desktop. Do not run it from a network share or synced folder.
Save it to:
C:\Users\<yourusername>\Desktop

2. Run the Script
- Double-click the .ps1 file on your desktop.
- When the UAC prompt appears, enter your admin credentials.
- The Remote PC Info window will appear.
- Enter the remote computer name (example: PC12345).
- Click "Get Info" to retrieve system details.

Important Notes:
- The script will not run properly from network locations such as file shares, OneDrive, Teams, or SharePoint.
- Running locally is required for UAC elevation and for the GUI to display correctly.
- Remote queries require that the target PC is powered on and reachable on the network.
- If you see "Unavailable" for any item, the PC may be offline, blocked by firewall, or you may lack permissions.

Troubleshooting:

Problem: Script closes immediately after UAC prompt.
Cause: Script was run from a network path or cloud-synced folder.
Solution: Move the script to your local desktop and run it again.

Problem: No information returned for the remote PC.
- Verify the PC name is correct.
- Confirm the PC is powered on.
- Ensure you used administrative credentials.
- Make sure firewall settings allow remote WMI/CIM queries.
